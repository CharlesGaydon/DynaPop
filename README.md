This work was done as part of a Population Simulation lecture.

It consists of a simulation of a Prey-Predator dynamic, based on a simple non geographical model, that took place in 2016. It can be used as a source of ideas if one has to draw some phase portrait in this kind of context.

Note : images are here for insight only, but translated versions can be obtained directly from a software like Rstudio.
